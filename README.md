## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-Time Control**: Instantly syncs with your bulb's state using an efficient MQTT-first approach, backed by HTTP polling.
- **Full Power Control**: Toggle the bulb on or off with a satisfying, responsive button.
- **White Ambiance**: Fine-tune color temperature from warm (153 mired) to cool (500 mired).
- **RGB Color Selection**: An intuitive hue and saturation slider lets you pick the perfect color.
- **Brightness Dimmer**: Adjust brightness levels from 0% to 100%.
- **Secure Authentication**: Protects your dashboard with a mandatory API key.
- **PWA-Compatible**: Install it as a standalone app on desktop or mobile for a native-like experience with offline support.
- **Live Device Info**: Monitor critical details at a glance:
  - IP Address & Hostname
  - Firmware Version & Module
  - Wi-Fi Signal Strength & Uptime
  - Boot Count & Restart Reason
- **Live Logging**: A toggleable console to view raw MQTT message data for easy debugging.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

This project consists of a lightweight Express backend and a vanilla JavaScript frontend.

-   **Backend (Express.js & TypeScript)**:
    -   Connects securely to your MQTT broker.
    -   Subscribes to Tasmota's `stat/`, `tele/`, and `discovery` topics to listen for real-time state changes.
    -   Publishes commands to the `cmnd/` topic to control the bulb.
    -   Serves the frontend application and provides a simple, authenticated API for the client to fetch status and send commands.
    -   Uses **Zod** for robust and type-safe validation of all incoming API requests.
    -   Uses **Winston** for structured, detailed logging.

-   **Frontend (HTML, CSS, JS)**:
    -   A responsive, mobile-first single-page application built with **Tailwind CSS**.
    -   Communicates with the backend via a simple API.
    -   Features a service worker (`service-worker.js`) for PWA functionality and offline caching of assets.
    -   Dynamically updates the UI based on the latest device state received from the backend.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A Tasmota-flashed smart bulb connected to your network.
- An MQTT broker (e.g., [HiveMQ](https://www.hivemq.com/), [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/)).
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher) for local development.
- A [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) account for easy deployment.

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project or configure these directly in your Vercel project settings.

| Variable | Description | Example Value | Required |

| `MQTT_HOST`| Address of your MQTT broker. | `your-id.s1.eu.hivemq.cloud`| **Yes** |
| `MQTT_PORT`| Port for your MQTT broker. | `8883` | **Yes** |
| `MQTT_USERNAME`| MQTT broker username. | `my-tasmota-user` | Optional |
| `MQTT_PASSWORD`| MQTT broker password. | `MyMQTTPassword` | Optional |
| `MQTT_PROTOCOL`| Connection protocol (`mqtts` or `mqtt`).| `mqtts` | **Yes** |
| `MQTT_TOPIC`| Base topic of your Tasmota device. | `tasmota_368072` | **Yes** |
| `TASMOTA_MAC`| MAC address of your device (no colons).| `40F520368072` | **Yes** |
